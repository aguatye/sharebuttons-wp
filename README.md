# Social Sharing Buttons - do not track 
Social Sharing plugin for WordPress - Simple sharing buttons without tracking  

When you add or embed standard sharing buttons using the normal embedding scripts from the popular social networks, it includes a tracking feature, so no matter if people uses the sharing button they are still tracked. And if you look for sharing button plugins for WordPress it is a typical feature to have data collection for usage and behavioural statistics build into the plugin.

To avoid the data collection from third parties Privacore created a simple plugin for the Privacore website to get sharing icons for twitter, Facebook and Linked in on the posts.
